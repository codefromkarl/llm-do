# Aurora Solar Storage

## Problem
Industrial campuses and logistics parks cannot meet peak power needs with
existing grid capacity. Diesel backups are expensive and emit tons of CO2.

## Solution
Aurora builds prefabricated battery containers that ship fully assembled and
install in under 48 hours. The control software arbitrages on-site solar,
utility power, and wholesale rates to flatten peak demand charges.

## Team
- CEO Maya Delgado (ex-Tesla energy growth lead)
- CTO Arjun Menon (designed the control stack for Fluence)
- COO Patrice Osei (scaled Flexport fulfillment to $900M ARR)

## Traction
- 18 units deployed across Arizona + Nevada fulfillment centers
- $12.4M ARR with 140% net revenue retention
- LOI with TerraLogix for 40 additional sites (~$55M TCV)

## Market
Over 60,000 U.S. facilities pay peak charges above $50k/month. Aurora targets
logistics and cold storage first, representing a $9B SAM.

## Financials
- Hardware gross margin: 32% (target 43% in 18 months)
- Software subscription: $8k/month/site with 85% margin
- Blend to EBITDA breakeven forecasted in Q4 next year

## Needs
$35M Series B to finance working capital, expand manufacturing capacity, and
build service teams in Texas + the Midwest.
