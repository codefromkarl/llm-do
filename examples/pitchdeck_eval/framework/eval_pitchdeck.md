## Evaluation Guidelines

### Be Specific
- Cite slide numbers when referencing information
- Quote specific metrics and claims
- Note what's missing or unclear

### Flag Assumptions
- Distinguish between facts stated in deck vs. your inferences
- Explicitly call out assumptions you're making
- Note areas requiring clarification

### Be Honest
- This is internal assessment - be direct about concerns
- Call out red flags clearly
- Note both strengths and weaknesses

### Provide Context
- Consider stage-appropriate expectations
- Compare to similar companies/deals
- Note market/sector-specific factors

## Customization

This framework is intentionally generic. To make it your own:

1. **Add your investment thesis** - What types of companies/markets do you focus on?
2. **Define scoring criteria** - Create quantitative scoring if helpful
3. **Add deal-breakers** - What automatically disqualifies a deal?
4. **Incorporate your experience** - Add sector-specific evaluation criteria
5. **Include your process** - What comes after pitchdeck evaluation?

## Notes

- Keep evaluations in version control for team collaboration
- Update framework based on learnings from past investments
- Standardization helps compare deals, but don't force-fit every pitch
- The goal is better investment decisions, not perfect evaluations
