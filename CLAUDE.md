# Instructions for Claude and AI Assistants

Read and follow the guidance in `AGENTS.md`.

Key points:
- Run `pytest` before committing
- Never use `git add -A` — review and stage specific files
- No backwards compatibility constraints
- Balance simplicity with good design
- Template files must end in `.yaml`
- Use `LLM_DO_DEBUG=1` for debugging

For detailed guidance, see `AGENTS.md`.
